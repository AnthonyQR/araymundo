        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Anthony Raymundo. I am 17 and am fresh out of high school from Sullivan Heights.
            I was born in the Philippines and moved to Canada in 2010. In my free time, I like to play
            a lot of video games and play music as a bass guitarist. I have some experience with html and
            css and I hope to improve my skills and gain new ones in my courses.
