        <h2>Work/Volunteer Experience</h2>
        <p>Summer 2015, BGC Engineering, Vancouver, British Columbia, Storage Organizer, Contact name: James Raymundo, Contact info: 604-505-8704</p>

        <p>I am very fluent in speaking English as well as reading and writing in the language. I can also speak Tagalog well and understand the language enough to have conversations with most people very easily.</p>
        <h2>Extracuricular Activities/Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have loved music for many years but I only started to play music starting in grade 6. Now I am able to play the bass guitar and am learning to play the acoustic guitar. I feel that playing music requires a lot of concentration and quick reflexes to use which I feel will make me an asset in your company. I also love playing a lot of video games ever since I was a kid and I feel that playing them has let me practice skills that could be great in the workforce. I have played games that required a lot of strategic thinking or quick reflexes or finding solutions to a variety of puzzles all of which requires a lot of concentration and I feel that all of these skills will make me a helpful asset for your company.</p>
